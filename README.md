# Web Developer Assessment – Zero Eight  

## Objective  
Implement the provided Figma design as a functional and responsive web section.  

## Instructions  
1. Complete the HTML file and link the necessary styles.  
2. Submit your work as a `.zip` file named **candidate-name.zip** to [pablo@zeroeight.us](mailto:pablo@zeroeight.us).  
3. Use the subject line: **Zero Eight – Web Developer Job Opening**.  

## What We Evaluate  
- **HTML semantics** – Proper structure and meaningful elements.  
- **Class usage** – Clean, organized, and maintainable.  
- **UX decisions** – How you handle missing breakpoints.  

## Context  
This exercise has **no strict time limit**, but it shouldn’t take more than **20 minutes** to complete. We’re looking for **precision in execution and good decision-making**—focus on a well-structured and scalable implementation. Once submitted, we aim to review your work within **72 hours**.  

You received a **`.fig` file in the project root** containing the design. Open it in **Figma** to view the section to implement. Normally, you’d get desktop, tablet, and mobile versions, but this time only desktop is available.  

### Why?  
Well… the mobile and tablet versions got lost. It happens. If this were a real project, you'd probably reach out to the designer—but in this case, you’ll need to **adapt the design to be fully responsive**. The project notes suggest that a **1.19 typography scale** works well for mobile, so that might be a good starting point.  

### Tech Guidelines  
- Use **vanilla HTML and CSS**.  
- You may use **any CSS framework** (e.g., Tailwind) or structure styles with **BEM** if you prefer.  
- The implementation only needs to be **functional in Chromium-based browsers**. No testing will be done outside of this.  

We’ve **blurred out other sections** in the design file to keep the focus on the one you need to implement. Stick to what’s provided—extra sections or structures won’t be considered.  

### Important Note  
This is **not production code**, so aspects like performance optimization or extensive accessibility testing are not required. What matters is **how you approach the task**—the clarity of your structure, the maintainability of your styles, and how well your solution adapts to different screen sizes.  

Some aspects of the implementation allow for interpretation (not many, really), but if something isn’t specified, make a reasonable decision. We may discuss your approach in a review.  

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
